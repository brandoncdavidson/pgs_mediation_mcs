# Davidson et al., 2025: "Early Developmental Markers of Genetic Influences on Academic Attainment"

A repository for the research study *"Early Developmental Markers of Genetic Influences on Academic Attainment"* by Davidson, Austerberry & Fearon (2025).

This repository is broken down into three sub-sections:

*1. Data Pre-Processing*

This contains the 4 scripts to clean MCS files, merge data and standardise/regress polygenic scores such that they can be taken forward for analysis.

*2. Descriptive Statistics*

This contains the 1 script to calculate preliminary N values, means, standard deviations and allows for comparison of genetic and non-genetic samples.

*3. MPlus Model Scripts*

This contains the 4 .inp files that can be read into MPlus to reproduce the structural models.
